# cruise-travel
This is the repo for the code made during Lauzhack 2018 for the cruise-travel project.

The goal of this project is to enable a group of friends living in different places to find a destination for spending a week-end together for either the fastest or cheapest travel solution.

It runs as a webpage built with bootstrap.
